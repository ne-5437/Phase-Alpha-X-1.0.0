    <p>Observe the size of the following : </p> <hr>
    <h1>This is the Title</h1>
    <h2>This is the Title</h2>
    <h3>This is the Title</h3>
    <h4>This is the Title</h4>
    <h5>This is the Title</h5>
    <h6>This is the Title</h6> <hr>
    <p>These headings from h1 - h6 not only visually show how the sizes are formatted on the page, but we can style these further with CSS! These give meaning to the content (differentiating topic and sub-topics). Now we have another tag "hr" in html to define horizontal rule (To our observation, this adds lines), which just divides the content to different sections</p> <hr>
    <h1>This is the Title 2</h1>
    <h2>This is the Title 2</h2>
    <h3>This is the Title 2</h3>
    <h4>This is the Title 2</h4>
    <h5>This is the Title 2</h5>
    <h6>This is the Title 2</h6> <hr>
    <p>
        We also have line breaks using "br" to just break the line and <br> ...to continue on the next line
    </p> <hr>
    <p>
        The next one is "em" to emphasize the line,<em>an inline element which provides a somatic meaning to the line. Also italisize the text!</em> And to further emphasize we have a <strong> "strong" element, which also makes the text bold. </strong> 
    </p> <hr>
    <p> We can access many HTML Entities starting with "&" 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using 'nbsp' we can space this line over(in this case 4x) 
        <br>&lt; 'lt' stands for less than symbol
        <br>&copy; 'copy' represents copyright symbol
        <br>&gt; 'gt' for greater than symbol
        <br><br>
        Another inline function which helps with the abbreviations is "abbr" <abbr title="SPY x FAMILY">SxF</abbr> , where we can observe dots underneath SxF and we get a tool tip of its abbreviations. 
        <br>We can comments to code which are not visible to the user! by using '!The note for the developers' <hr>
        <br>We also have an "address" to define the content address to the user 
    </p>
    <address>
        Tequila Club, Leylime Road,
        <br>Miami Beach, Florida 53580.
    </address>
