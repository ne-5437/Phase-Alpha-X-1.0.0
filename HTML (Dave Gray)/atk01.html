    <h1>HTML Baseline</h1>

    <p>HTML is an acronym that stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Hypertext refers to links that connect web pages to one another. HTML uses Markup to annotate text, images and other content to display on the web <br>
    <br> The first element we use is "html" (type html & press tab to create opening & closing tags). Every page starts and ends with opening & closing tags <br> <br> HTML page has two main areas: <br>One area contains data not seen on the page but considered to be meta data about the page 7 that is "head" area. We put meta data inside the Head. <br> The next area is part of the page that everybody sees in the browser & that is held within body element. <br> <br> Let us give a "title" element Ascension Phase 01 which gives the webpage title (but not inside the body of the page). <br> html lang attribute can be supplies with en-US dilects, which defines the language. Inside the head there are meta data elements, where we can observe "meta charset" attribute which is standard for webpages UTF-8. And finally !DOCTYPE html must be at the very first line of your page, doc type declaration which is must. We can add more meta data, as in the code: name(author, description) attributes. We can link page icon "rel=icon" & its hypertext reference "href=dpi01.png" & the type of the icon.<br> <br> <br> <h3>HTML Basic Tags:</h3>

    <'body> </'body> - Sets off the visible portion of the document <br>
    <'title> <'/title> - Puts name of the document in the title bar; when bookmarking pages, this is what is bookmarked <br>
    <'h1> <'/h1> To <'h6> <'/h6> - Creates headlines â€” H1=largest, H6=smallest <br>
    <'b> <'/b> - Creates bold text (should use <'strong> instead) <br>
    <'i> <'/i> - Creates italicized text (should use <'em> instead) <br>
